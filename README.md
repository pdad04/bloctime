## About Bloctime

Bloctime is a Pomodoro Timer which uses the Pomodoro Technique.

The Pomodoro Technique aims to increase your work productivity and quality. In its simplest form, you time your work in 25-minute intervals, with five-minute breaks in between.

During a 25-minute session, you focus on a task. Checking email, answering the phone, or browsing your favorite forum is not allowed. During a break, you do not do anything related to work. You can meditate, do push ups and play with your dog, but you can't think about work.

When implemented with discipline, the Pomodoro Technique can be a powerful tool to increase your productivity. You will build an application to manage your Pomodoro sessions.
